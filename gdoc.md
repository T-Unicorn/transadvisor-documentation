An about section for the website
TransAdvisor was created for trans people by a collaboration of trans people
and trans allies who have an interest in building software solutions to make
trans people’s lives easier. It came into being at Trans*Code, in March 2015. 

TransAdvisor is designed to help people who fall under the trans umbrella make
choices about the healthcare providers they access by providing reviews of how
trans-friendly a healthcare provider or institution is, according to trans
people who have accessed that service. Trans people can then find out how
trans-friendly their local health services are before they visit, and
potentially switch healthcare providers based on reviews of both individuals
and institutions.

Welcome paragraph for home page:

Welcome to TransAdvisor - the website for trans people to review their
healthcare and search for trans-friendly healthcare providers. GPs, sexual
health services, mental health services and other healthcare providers can make
accessing health care easier or harder depending on their attitude towards and
knowledge and experience of trans issues. Accessing health care can be
intimidating if you don’t know how your gender presentation or identity will be
received by your caregiver - TransAdvisor aims to help trans people access
friendly and inclusive healthcare and alert other trans people to healthcare
providers and institutions that might make them feel unwelcome and unsafe. 

Catchy tagline for the top of website: Forewarned is forearmed. Its this too
confrontational?

Statements from doctors/institutions

Space under doctor/institutions for them to send us a statement regarding how
trans-friendly they are Information for professionals looking improve their
care of trans patients - e.g. 

Guides: - Things to think about when writing your review of Individual: When
you are writing a about a person try to be respectful, however some people are
more respectful than others so it is understandable if you just want to advise
people to stay away.  Good things to include would be how did they treat you,
how they referred to you, and what sort of action they took/advised.


Things to think about when writing your review of the Institution: When you are
writing about an Institution, if the experience was less than ideal, try and
think about what you would have wanted.  Good things to include would be where
the reception staff respectful ? Did they make the effort to listen to you &
understand. Did they call out (correct) names & pronouns in the waiting room or
was it anonymised eg with ticket numbers? How was the accessibility of the
location? Were you asked questions which seemed irrelevant to your visit & were
inappropriate or overly personal ?
 
You may not want to talk about general problems such as long waiting times or
location that are already covered by more general reviews medical reports.

health care or health advice that you would want to know more information about

Trans = anyone who identifies as trans or falling under the trans umbrella,
including men and women who identity differently to the gender they were
assigned at birth, genderqueer, genderfluid and gender-neutral/non-binary
people, intersex people and anyone else who does not identify as cisgender.

Cisgender = individuals who identify with the gender they were assigned at
birth. If you identify as cisgender, please recommend this website to your
trans friends. 

These gender definitions are not perfect, exhaustive or set in stone. 

Advice about accessing health care Information to people about how to access
healthcare and what to expect.

Accessing health care if your gender identity or presentation does not align
with what your doctor might expect can be anything from needlessly
uncomfortable to downright impossible. 

Doctors and other healthcare providers will not necessarily have training
specifically for or know protocols gender identity issues.  Before approaching
a doctor to access such services it is advisable to be clear about what you
want to happen, what you want your doctor to do for you and to know what the
protocols are for accessing the services that you want as you will probably
need to explain the protocols to your GP.

A good starting point to find about accessing NHS services is here:-
